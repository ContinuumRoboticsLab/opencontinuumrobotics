The Orm (Norwegian for snake) is an air-powered robot arm developed by two students at Stanford University in 1965, Victor Scheinman and Larry Leifer.
Motion is achieved by 28 inflatable pneumatic bellow actuators sandwiched between seven metal disks that were either fully extended or fully contracted. 
The design was abandoned because the robot's motion could not be repeated accurately. 
The robot was abandoned as the repeatability was considered not accurate enough. 
Today, the Orm is displayed in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, USA. 
According to the definition of a continuum robot, the Orm is a redundant robot as the seven disks are connected via ball joints. 
Yet, the Orm is considered as one of the first quasi-continuous robots.
