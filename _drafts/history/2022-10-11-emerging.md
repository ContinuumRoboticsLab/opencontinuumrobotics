In the 1990s, continuum robotic research from the previous decade has been continued and taken up by additional research groups.
On the one hand, we have seen further developments in elephants trunk inspired continuum robots.
On the other hand, researchers investigated novel designs in order to reduce the size of continuum robots.	 
The focus laid on either purely fluid-driven continuum robots or hybrid continuum robots which additionally use tendon/wire actuation.
In addition to the advancements in continuum robot design, more advanced results have been obtained on modeling for continuum robotics, which marks an important milestone for advanced developments.

## Continuum Robot becomes a Term
Before the 1990s, continuum robots have been called "highly-articulated", "tentacle", or "flexible" robots. In the early 1990s, Chirikjian and Burdick coined the term of ***hyper-redundant*** manipulators[^fn0].

Hyper-redundant manipulators
: a robot with many more degrees of freedom than the minimum required for a task.

Chirikjian and Burdick differentiate
> A ***discrete*** morphology manipulator [...] with a large, but finite number of rigid links. A ***continuous*** morphology manipulator [...] whose actuation is distrubuted over the robot's length and whose shape is continously deformable.[^fn4]

As such, continuum robots belong to the broader category of hyper-redundant manipulators.
The term ***continuum robot*** was established by Robinson and Davies in 1999 in the first state of the art paper[^fn1] published at ICRA. 
They define continuum robots in contrast to discrete mechanisms:

Continuum robots
: > do not contain rigid links and identifiable rotational joints. Instead the structures bend continuously along their length via elastic deformation and produce motion through the generation of smooth curves, similar to the tentacles or tongues of the animal kingdom.[^fn1]

Beside defining the category of continuum robots, Robinson and Davies also classify the types of actuation in intrinsic, extrinsic, and hybrid for differentiation of continuum robot types.

## Hybrid Continuum Robot Systems
A hybrid continuum robot system of fluidic-driven pneumatic bellows and tendon wires, inspired by elephant trunks and tentacles was introduced in the mid 1990s by Immega and Antonelli[^fn3]. 
The prototype can extend, contract, and bend in 6 DOF by using tendons threaded through cable guides.
This continuum robot was developed by Kinetic Sciences Inc. with a patent[^fn3] filed in 1992 and granted in 1994.
Yet, the robot was never commercially available.

## Fiber-reinforced Soft Continuum Robots
Soft continuum robotics research advanced towards small diameter designs, by the introduction of fiber-reinforced robot designs by Suzumori et al. in 1991[^fn3b].
A silicon rubber bladder is restricted in radial expansion by fiber-reinforcement such that pressurization causes elongation rather than shortening. 
The design requires low pressure for operation and is scalable.
The smallest diameter prototype was realized with 1 mm.
Intended use of the design is for multiple applications, such as a four-fingered robot hand, a series of fiber-reinforced segments as a manipulator, or a six-legged walking robot.

## Backbone Curves
Progress and innovation in continuum robot modeling, particularly in kinematics took place in the 1990s. 
An important milestone is the work of Greg Chirikjian who introduced the backbone curve approach to model the kinematics[^fn4] and the dynamics[^fn5] of hyper-redundant robots. 
His approach allows to determine the continuous morphology of a robot with a large or infinite degree of kinematic redundancy, typically the centerline or spine.
Chirikjian assumes the backbone curve to be a piecewise continuous curve and describes the morphology in respect to a reference backbone curve.
The use of backbone curve alongside model reduction (Chirikjian used a modal approach[^fn4]) marks a fundamental modeling approach used in continuum robotics until today.
