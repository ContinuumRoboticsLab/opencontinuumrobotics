The elephant trunk often serves as an inspiration for continuum robots. 
The first continuum robot inspired by the morphology of an elephant trunk was proposed by *Morecki et al.*[^fn1]. 
A publication in the late 1990s summarized the developments which originated in the late 1980s [^fn2].
Initially, the intended use of the elephant trunk like robot was as a manipulator on a quadruped walking robot.
Later, the researchers proposed to use the elephant trunk robot for transportation of bulk and liquid materials in workspaces with obstacles through small holes.
The manipulator has three segments: a base, a middle, and a shorter wrist segment.
The backbone is a coil spring and actuation is achieved by cables.
