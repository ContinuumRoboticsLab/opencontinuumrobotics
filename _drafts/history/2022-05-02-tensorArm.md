The Tensor Arm is a cable-driven hinged robot manipulator which was first presented in 1967. The manipulator is composed of a series of fifteen disks which are interconnected via universal joints and have multiple tendon routing channels. Actuation is achieved by tendons which terminate at respective disks. The design was patented in 1970 [^fn1]. According to the definition of a continuum robot, also the Tensor Arm is a quasi-continous but hyperredundant robot due to the presence of universal joints connecting the disks.
