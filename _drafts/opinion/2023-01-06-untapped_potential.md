Research on continuum robots has been primarily focussed on medical robotics, where continuum robots are teleoperated by a physician who is in full control of robot motion at all times. In interventional medicine, robotically-steered catheters and bronchoscopes are essentially long continuum robots whose tips are articulated while navigating through the vasculature or the airways. Although use in medical robotics is compelling, I argue that the opportunities for continuum robotics remain largely unexploited, as the medical focus restricts and constrains robot embodiment, control strategies, level of autonomy, and available feedback. 

## Why are Continuum Robots predominantly explored for medicial applications?
Looking at the history of continuum robotics, early research has focussed on larger scale continuum robots. Prototypes have been built comparable in size to industrial serial arm robots. This probably lead to similar expectations: If an industrial robot arm could achieve superior accuracy and repeatabilty with high payloads and at high speed, why would one need a continuum robot performing worse on this scale? Repeatability, accuracy, speed, and payload are non unique selling points of continuum robots. Poised by the third industrial revolution in the late sixties and early seventies of the 19th century, roboticists naturally focussed on robot types applicable to automation and its goals. Consequently, continuum robotics remained a niche research area for a while.

The late eigthies brought change. With the invention of small-scale continuum robots by the researchers around Hirose in Japan, continuum robotics found an application area: Medicine!
In contrast to industrial automation, small-scale continuum robots promised significant benefit over serial robot arms! Surgical robotics was just on the onset in the mid eighties and was using repurposed industrial robots such as the PUMA 560 in neurosurgery.

The trend towards more minimally invasive  MIS and keyhole for patient benefit, shorter hopsitalization and recovery

rather than large incision, opening the body, sneak in! various medical discplines would benefit

dextrous motion capabilties, ability to reach more defining than accuracy!


## The Untapped Potential
I believe, that we as continuum robotics researchers, should turn to non-medical use-cases to invent the next-generation of continuum robot systems with autonomous capabilities. By focussing on medical applications, we have naturally limited our design choices to certain continuum robot sizes, materials, workspaces, control paradigms, etc. that are informed by the medical application. In fact, most medical continuum robots are rather short if they can work in free spaces or need the environmental constraints for steering (such as vasculature for robotic catheters). 

The untapped potential of continuum robots is enormous! Think about autonomous small-scale or medium-scale continuum robots in in-situ and non-destructive inspection, maintenance, repair, and operations. On-wing jet engine inspection provides an example of a keyhole procedure, where a technician inspects components such as  turbine blades and the combustion chamber using a flexible camera, called a borescope, through tiny access points on the engine. This is a cumbersome procedure requiring an expert to fiddle with the borescope in hunched body postures, with limited time, as the plane stands ready for takeoff.  If an issue is overlooked, e.g., a small crack in a blade, it may be disastrous and result in a worst-case scenario of the engine blowing off during flight. At the same time, full service of an engine means that it must be taken off-wing for maintenance â€“ a costly endeavour. This in-situ inspection is just one of many examples where we can build on our expertise in continuum robotics in the medical domain and innovate the next generation of autonomous continuum robot systems. I envision these robots to be of small scale, dextrous enough to enter an environment for in-situ inspection, maintenance, and repair through multiple keyholes, and to act autonomously, able to collaborate with one another to achieve the task.
