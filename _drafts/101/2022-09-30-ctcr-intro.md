Tubular continuum robots or concentric tube continuum robots (CTCR) are
the smallest among all continuum robots with typical diameter to length
ratios of 1:250. The composition of concentrically arranged elastic
tubes with pre-curvatures allows for simple, yet dextrous, robotic
manipulators at a millimetre scale. Actuation is achieved mechanically
by relative rotation and axial translation of the tubes and results in
tentacle-like motions. CTCR are particularly
promising for medical interventions, such as
diagnosis through natural orifices or minimally invasive surgery. In today's post, 
we review the general structure of CTCR and look into
the motion capabilities and underlying mechanics. 

## General Design

This type of continuum robot design relies on a backbone composed of
multiple concentric compliant tubes. The tubes are free to move
(translate and rotate) with respect to each other (subject to hardware
limits) with the translations and rotations actuated at the base of the
robot. The net effect is similar to a telescope: the structure can
extend and contract by translational sliding of the tubes. To achieve
more complex motions than a simple telescope, pre-curved compliant tubes
are used. The tubes can be directly controlled in terms of extension and
contraction as well as their relative rotation in respect to one another.

The achievable range of curvatures of the continuum
robot are defined by the elastic interaction of the pre-curved tubes as
they conform to an equilibrium state. In
principle, each of the component tubes can
have an arbitrary precurvature. Most commonly, each tube is either
straight or precurved with planar constant curvature, or a combination
of a straight section followed by a constant curvature section.

NiTi (nickel titanium, also Nitinol) is a shape memory alloy and most
commonly used as tube material for CTCR. NiTi alloys have two unique
properties: the shape memory effect and superelasticity. CTCR are based
on superelasticity, which is the ability for the metal to undergo large
deformations and immediately return to its undeformed shape upon removal
of the external load. NiTi can deform 10-30 times as much as ordinary
metals and return to its original shape. NiTi is also preferable for
CTCR as it is highly biocompatible and therefore safe to use in medical
robotics applications.

## Joint Space and Motion Capabilities

If multiple precurved tubes are placed concentrically, their curvatures
will interfere with one another, causing bending and making the combined
shape different from the natural shapes of the individual tubes. It is
this interference effect, combined with both rotation and
extension/retraction of the tubes, that we use to change the shape of
the CTCR and create motion.

CTCR are composed out of $$n \geq 2$$ (typically 3), precurved
superelastic tubes, which are inserted into one another. Each tube is
mechanically actuated and Ô¨Åxed in an actuation unit at the robot's base.

To understand the motion capabilities of CTCR, it is useful to consider
the interaction of two concentrically combined tubes.
Limiting cases of their interaction correspond to when the ratio of bending stiffnesses for the two tubes is
either very large, such that the shape of one tube dominates that of the
other, or the ratio is approximately one, such that the
tubes' shapes interact equally to determine the overall
shape. We refer to these cases as dominating stiffness pair and balanced
stiffness pair.

| **Dominating Stiffness Pair**: Since the bending stiffness of one tube is much larger than that of the other, the pair of concentric tubes conforms to the curvature of the stiffer tube. When the more flexible tube is translated such that it extends beyond the end of the stiff tube, the extended portion relaxes to its original curvature.|

| **Balanced Stiffness Pair**: The tubes are of similar stiffness such that their unstressed curvatures interact to determine their combined curvature. Relative rotation of the tubes causes the combined curvature to vary. |

A CTCR usually combines multiple tubes with either
pair type. The relative displacements of the
tubes and their axial rotation are then determining the resulting shape.
The tubes interact elastically and make one another bend and twist.

The innermost tube is then further extended. As all tubes can be axially rotated and extended/contracted, a multitude of possible shapes is attainable.|

## Summary

Today, we looked at the general structure of a CTCR as a
concentric assembly of pre-curved or straight tubes. Each tube is
rotated and translated at its base, with mechanical actuators located in
an actuation unit. Depending on the tube pre-curvature and stiffness, in
particular of the presence of dominating or balanced tube pairs, the
robot behaviour varies in terms of degree of freedom and motion
capabilities.
