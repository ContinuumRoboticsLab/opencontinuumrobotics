Continuum robots, oh so sleek<br>
With their flexible bodies and graceful movements unique<br>
They extend and they bend<br>
In ways that defy all comprehend

They twist and they turn<br>
In ways that make our hearts yearn<br>
They can adapt to any environment and task<br>
With a flexibility that's truly unmatched

With their long, continuous forms<br>
They can access places that other robots can't conform<br>
They can reach into tight spaces and contort with ease<br>
Bringing us closer to a world that's more agile and free

So here's to the continuum robots, the future of our time<br>
May they help us build a world that's more nimble and refined<br>
Where machines and humans work together as one<br>
Creating a better future, for everyone.
