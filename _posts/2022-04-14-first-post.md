# Welcome

After over a decade of research on continuum robotics, the time is right to empower the world with open hardware and open software to build their own continuum robots. At the [Continuum Robotics Lab](https://crl.utm.utoronto.ca), we are excited to share that we will be launching our open robotics project in 2022. 

Stay tuned for updates!
