# Welcome to the Open CR Project 
{: .text-center}
&nbsp;  

This project was launched by the [Continuum Robotics Laboratory](https://crl.utm.utoronto.ca) (CRL) at the University of Toronto in 2022. After a decade of research on continuum robotics, the time is right for us to empower the world with open hardware and open software to build their own continuum robots. With our blog, we are filling the gap between continuum robotics research papers and general robotics knowledge to provide entry-level educational content. We also cover best practices, historical perspectives, research news, etc.
