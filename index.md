# Welcome to the Open CR Project 
{: .text-center}

This project was launched by the [Continuum Robotics Laboratory](https://crl.utm.utoronto.ca) (CRL) at the University of Toronto in 2022. After a decade of research on continuum robotics, the time is right for us to empower the world with open hardware and open software to build their own continuum robots.
